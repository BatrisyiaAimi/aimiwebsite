<pre align="center"> Hy everyone my name is BATRISYIA AIMI BINTI SHAMSUL AZMIN.
I’m 20 years old and I was Born on 22/08/2001.
I born in Selangor and stay there until I’m 12 years old which is in 2013.
I have to move to Perak due to my parents’ job. 
I used to school at SK convent 2 klang and continue in SMK Tengku Menteri in Taiping 
and now I’m study at UITM Kedah in information management.
I chose this course because I think this course is fun and interesting to take. 
For the result, it is interesting to take and it very fun. 
To be honest I always thought that this course is easy but with the
hard work and focus on the subject, 
it will make it easier and understand the subject.
With the help and support from my family and friends, I would not be here now.
If you want to know more about my family, please visit <a href="family.html">MY FAMILY</a>page.
Other than that, while I have my free time,
I would help my family to make a video presentation. 
Please visit <a href="VIDEO.html">MY VIDEO</a> and <a href="album.html">MY PICTURE</a> page to watch the video that 
I made and some of my picture with my family and friends.</pre>
